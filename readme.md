# Cobalt915 for iTerm2 and ZSH

<!-- <img width="664" alt="iTerm2 cobalt915" src=""> -->

* `cobalt915.itermcolors` is cobalt915 theme for iTerm2 - This makes things blue and yellow.
* `cobalt915.zsh-theme` is the custom prompt for oh-my-zsh. It makes that cool line with folder and git status. 

They work well together! You will need to install the patched powerline font as well: <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>

#### Step-by-step installation
1. Drop the `cobalt915.zsh-theme` file in to the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Open up your ZSH preferences at `~/.zshrc` and change the theme variable to `ZSH_THEME="cobalt915"`.

3. Install Powerline and necessary fonts, one way is using [PIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager))
 * For first time *PIP* users refer to this [PIP installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
 * To install Powerline using pip
  ```
pip install --user powerline-status
  ```
 * Now install all necessary fonts by downloading or cloning git repository.

  ```
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts
cd fonts
./install.sh
  ```
  
> note: if you are using iTerm2, they now have a checkbox for Powerline fonts `Profiles` â†’ `Text`.

3. In iTerm2 access the *Preferences* pane on the *Profiles* tab.
4. Under the *Colors* tab import the `cobalt915.itermcolors` file via the *Load Presets* drop-down.
5. Under the *Text* tab change the font for each type (*Regular* and *Non-ASCII*) to '**Inconsolata for Powerline**'. (Refer to the [powerline-fonts repo](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for help on font installation.)
6. Refresh ZSH by typing `source ~/.zshrc` on the command line.
7. If you want the full blown tabs and everything shown in the screenshot, use the Profile in cobalt915.json.

##### ...in a MinTTY environment
1. Drop the `cobalt915.zsh-theme` file in to the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Open up your ZSH preferences at `~/.zshrc` and change the theme variable to `ZSH_THEME="cobalt915"`.
3. Install '**Inconsolata for Powerline**'. (Refer to the [powerline-fonts repo](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for help on font installation.)
4. Replace the `~/.minttyrc` file with the `.minttyrc` file in this repo.
5. Restart your terminal.
